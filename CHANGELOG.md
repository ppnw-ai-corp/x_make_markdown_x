# x_make_markdown_x — Production Ledger

I document every meaningful shift to this documentation furnace here. Entries follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic Versioning so auditors can match published PDFs to the code revision that forged them.

## [0.20.4] - 2025-10-15
### Changed
- Routed Markdown publishing through the shared exporter suite, logging `ExportResult` metadata for the Kanban evidence trail.
- README updated for the Road to 0.20.4 release to cover the exporter handoff and orchestrator summary wiring.

## [0.20.3] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- README and release notes rewritten to match the Road to 0.20.3 documentation cadence and acknowledge the JSON audit pivot.

## [0.20.2] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- Recast the documentation to match the Road to 0.20.2 release script, spelling out the refreshed publishing expectations for this generator.

## [0.20.1] - 2025-10-13
### Changed
- Updated README references to the Road to 0.20.1 control-room ledger so documentation tooling mirrors the live campaign.

## [0.20.0-prep] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Authored control-room aligned README and changelog to calibrate Markdown operations with the Road to 0.20.0 campaign.
- Linked the generator to diagramming and orchestration repos for fluid publishing cycles.

### Changed
- Encouraged contributors to document new components and exporters with Change Control entries—no silent drops.
